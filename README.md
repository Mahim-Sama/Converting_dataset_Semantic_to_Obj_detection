# Converting_dataset_Semantic_to_Obj_detection
### In this task:
+ I converted Semantic segmentations to object detection(bounding box annotations)
+ I used python OpenCV library for the main convertion task
+ I used the images from the dataset _**RescueNet** by **Rahnemoonfar** et.el._ for my task
+ Converted the coordinates of the mask objects to YOLO coordinate format 

## The bounding boxes were drawn considering the objects minimum area so that the bounding boxes don't overlap much
